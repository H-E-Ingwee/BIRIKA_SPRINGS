// script.js

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // This script will contain JavaScript specific to the current page.
    // For the home page, we'll ensure animations trigger correctly.

    // The CSS animations (fadeInDown, fadeInUp, zoomIn) are applied directly
    // via classes in the HTML. They will automatically play on page load.

    // If you had elements that load dynamically or needed specific JS triggers,
    // you would add them here.

    // Example: A simple console log to confirm script is loaded
    console.log("BIRIKA SPRINGS Home Page script loaded.");

    // You can add more complex animations or interactive elements here later.
    // For instance, if you wanted to observe elements coming into view to trigger animations
    // instead of on page load, you'd use Intersection Observer API.
});
